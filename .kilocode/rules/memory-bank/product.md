## Why This Project Exists

Lineage Incremental is a web-based incremental game designed to simulate a character's life progression through different age stages. The project was created to provide an engaging, choice-driven experience where players make decisions about life events that affect their character's stats, with the ultimate goal of surviving to old age and potentially continuing their lineage through children.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Monotony of Traditional Incremental Games**: Many incremental games follow a simple click-to-progress pattern. This game introduces meaningful choices with consequences, making each decision impactful.

2. **Lack of Narrative in Incremental Games**: By simulating life progression with age-appropriate events, the game provides a narrative framework that gives context to the player's actions.

3. **Limited Replayability**: The prestige system and family mechanics encourage multiple playthroughs with different strategies.

4. **No Real-time Feedback**: The stat preview system addresses the common problem in incremental games where players can't see the consequences of their choices before committing.

## How It Should Work

The game operates on a yearly progression system where:

1. **Age Progression**: Players age one year at a time, moving through distinct life stages (Baby, Child, Teenager, Adult, Elder).

2. **Event Selection**: At each age, players can select from available life events that provide stat bonuses but may also have penalties.

3. **Stat Management**: Players must balance their stats to minimize death risk while pursuing their goals.

4. **Family Mechanics**: Players can marry, have children, and eventually continue their lineage by playing as descendants.

5. **Prestige System**: At age 18, players can reset the game with enhanced starting stats for replayability.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Intuitive Interface**: Clear visual feedback with color-coded stats and real-time previews.

2. **Meaningful Choices**: Events should have both benefits and costs, requiring strategic thinking.

3. **Progressive Complexity**: Simple mechanics at the beginning that gradually introduce more complex systems.

4. **Risk/Reward Balance**: Death risk should feel threatening but not punitive, encouraging calculated risks.

5. **Satisfaction of Progression**: Clear visual and numerical feedback showing character development over time.

6. **Discovery Element**: Players should experiment with different event combinations to find optimal strategies.

7. **Emotional Connection**: The family mechanics should create a sense of legacy and continuation beyond a single life.
