# Context Documentation

## Current Work Focus
The project has undergone major refactoring to improve code maintainability, reduce complexity, and eliminate code duplication. All major modules have been restructured with clear separation of concerns.

## Recent Changes (2025-10-30)
- **Testing Setup**: Implemented Playwright E2E testing framework with basic homepage test
- **Configuration**: Added playwright.config.js with live-server integration for automated testing
- **Package.json**: Updated with Playwright dependencies and Jest configuration for unit testing

## Recent Changes (2025-10-29)
- **script.js**: Split complex 145-line gain click handler into 15+ smaller, well-documented functions
- **script.js**: Extracted 120+ lines of grid management code to new modules/grid.js module
- **modules/ui.js**: Eliminated code duplication in stat display logic, created unified rendering functions
- **modules/events.js**: Simplified complex event HTML generation, split updateEventsList into smaller functions
- **modules/events.js**: Created unified penalty calculation system with clear breakdown
- **modules/game.js**: Added comprehensive documentation and organized death calculation logic
- **constants.js**: Added missing constants for penalty thresholds and system configuration
- **utils.js**: Added unified penalty calculation system with detailed breakdown and explanation
- **Documentation**: All functions now have comprehensive JSDoc-style documentation

## Code Improvements Made
- **Complexity Reduction**: Split large functions (100+ lines) into focused, single-responsibility functions
- **Code Duplication Eliminated**: Unified stat display logic, event rendering, and penalty calculations
- **Documentation Added**: Comprehensive documentation for all public functions
- **Constants Centralized**: All magic numbers moved to constants.js with meaningful names
- **Modular Design**: Separated grid management into its own module
- **Unified Systems**: Created centralized penalty calculation system for consistency

## Next Steps
- Test all refactored functionality to ensure no regressions
- Address any remaining UI bugs in bug_list.md
- Potential expansion of the Empire and Universe tabs (currently placeholders)
- Expand Playwright E2E test coverage for game mechanics
- Performance optimization based on testing results

## Project Status
- **Code Quality**: Significantly improved with modular design and comprehensive documentation
- **Core Functionality**: All functionality maintained during refactoring
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive with JSDoc-style comments
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E testing framework implemented with basic homepage test
- **Future Features**: Empire and Universe tabs planned but not implemented
- **Active Issues**: Testing needed to verify refactored functionality
