# Context Documentation

## Current Work Focus
The project has undergone significant refactoring to improve code maintainability. The focus is now on maintaining the refactored codebase and ensuring all functionality works correctly after the changes.

## Recent Changes
- Major refactoring completed: replaced magic numbers with constants, factorized redundant code
- Created constants.js with centralized configuration values
- Created utils.js with shared utility functions
- Updated all modules to use constants and utilities
- Updated data files to reference constants where applicable

## Next Steps
- Address UI bugs in bug_list.md (specifically the selectable event counter display)
- Potential expansion of the Empire and Universe tabs (currently placeholders)
- Possible refinement of the event system and balance
- Testing framework implementation (tests directory exists but is empty)
- Documentation improvements
- Verify refactored functionality works correctly in browser

## Project Status
- **Core Functionality**: Complete and functional
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive requirements document exists
- **Testing**: Framework not yet implemented
- **Future Features**: Empire and Universe tabs planned but not implemented
- **Active Issues**: UI bug in event selection counter display
