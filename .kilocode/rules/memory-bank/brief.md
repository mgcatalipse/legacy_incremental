# Memory Bank Brief

## Project Overview
This is a web-based incremental game called "Lineage Incremental" that simulates a character's life progression through different age stages. Players make choices about life events that affect their stats, with the goal of surviving to old age and potentially continuing their lineage through children.

## Core Mechanics
- **Age Progression**: Character ages from 0 to potentially 200+ years
- **Stat System**: Three categories of stats (innate, skills, possessions) that influence gameplay
- **Life Events**: Age-appropriate events with positive effects and penalties
- **Death Risk**: Calculated based on age group, health, stress, and luck
- **Lineage System**: Marriage, children, and successor selection for continuity

## Key Features
- Real-time stat previews when selecting events
- Penalty system for over-selecting events
- Prestige system for replayability
- Family tree mechanics with stat inheritance
- Dynamic UI with resizable panels

## Current State
The game is functional with core mechanics implemented, including stat previews, event selection, death calculations, and basic family mechanics. Future expansions planned for empire and universe scales.
